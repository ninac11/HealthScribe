# HealthScribe

This repository contains our Natural Language Processing Project (NLP) HealthScribe which contains the code we utilized to train a model to classify health transcription data by medical specialty. 

To run the code, download the csv file and the ipynb file and change the appropriate file paths and follow other instructions in the comments of the ipynb file.
